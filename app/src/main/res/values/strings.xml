    <string name="description">We happily give piano lessons to children of all ages. Our lessons
        are offered in 15 minute increments so you can learn a little, or a lot with an hour-long
        lesson. We have qualified instructors that can teach at each level we offer: beginner,
        intermediate and advanced. Our price per lesson depends on duration (up to and including an
        hour) and level. Come join us and learn a new skill and creative outlet!</string>
